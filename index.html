    <h1>Han Show First</h1> <!-- First headline and the most important element on the page -->
    
    <img src="images/hansolo.jpg" alt="Han Solo"> <!-- This is the image element and desciption for accessibility-->
    
    <p>Geaorge Lucas thought the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantina made Han Solo cold blooded. Let's think about the original scene, shall we? Greedo the bounty hunter is holding Han at gunpoint and says in his gurgly voice he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em>, not cold.</p>
    
    <h2>Other Things Han Shoot at First</h2> <!-- Second headline -->
